# Text-Vertical-Slide-Animation
Text Vertical Slide Animation is a SwiftUI component that smoothly cycles through placeholder suggestions like “flights”, “airlines”, and “airports” using vertical slide and fade animations. Ideal for search bars and onboarding UIs, it adds a dynamic and engaging experience with minimal setup.
